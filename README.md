* Steps to create a Copy of this Repo on your local machine visit [here](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise/2.13/user/articles/cloning-a-repository).

* Then make changes to the code.
* Then to check status of your repository use `git status`.
* Then to stage the changes made to the code use `git add [filename]`. You can even use 
`git add .` to stage all the changes made to the code.
* Then to commit changes use `git commit -m "Commit message"`.
* Then create a branch in the remote repository with name as `[your-name]_dev`. 
* Then push those changes to the remote repository use `git push origin [your-name]_dev`.

## Step to submit a change:
1. After pushing the changes to your branch, you need to create a pull request using the GUI of Github.
2. Clearly mention the changes made in the description. 
3. All collaborators have the authority to merge pull requests to the master branch.
4. We will follow a policy where no collaborator is expected to merge any pull request unless 2 other collaborators have reviewed the changes and commented the request as verified.
