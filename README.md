# Spoiler Detection in Movie Review

## Step to submit a change:
1. After pushing the changes to your branch, you need to create a pull request using the GUI of Github.
2. Clearly mention the changes made in the description. 
3. All collaborators have the authority to merge pull requests to the master branch.
4. We will follow a policy where no collaborator is expected to merge any pull request unless 2 other collaborators have reviewed the changes and commented the request as verified.
